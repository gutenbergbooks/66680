</p>

<p>In the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> (t. 7166) 1891, an excellent figure of this
species was given with some critical notes by Sir Joseph Hooker on the
taxonomic affinities of the species, and recently (Kew Bulletin, 1920)
Mr. J. Hutchinson dealt more fully with the group represented by our
plant. He has established Bojer’s MS. name <i>Clematopsis</i>, under which he
describes 15 species of which only <i>C. Stanleyi</i> occurs within our
limits. The separation of <i>Clematopsis</i> from <i>Clematis</i> is based on the
aestivation of the sepals and for a full account of these differences
the reader is referred to Mr. Hutchinson’s article. The chief interest
in the genus is the fact that it forms a connecting link between the
tribes <i>Anemoneae</i> and <i>Clematideae</i>, which were hitherto supposed to be
sharply demarcated. It is confined to the ancient plateau of Africa and
its continuation in Madagascar.</p>

<p><i>Clematopsis Stanleyi</i> is a fairly common plant in parts of the
Transvaal and has been recorded from the Pretoria, Witwatersrand,
Waterberg, Middleburg Districts, and it extends into Rhodesia and
Angola. In habit it is a small shrub 18 inches to 2 feet high and when
in full bloom is a very pleasing object and well worth the attention of
horticulturists. When in fruit the beauty of the plant is not entirely
lost as the long white plumose styles stand out in sharp contrast to the
surrounding vegetation.</p>

<p>The specimen figured here was collected by Miss S. Gower at Krugersdorp
in February 1922.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A small shrub 45-60 cm. high. <i>Branches</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> ribbed, villous.

<hr />

<p>Mr. T. P. Stokoe, to whom we are indebted for so many of the interesting
plants figured in earlier plates of this work, has again contributed two
exquisite species of <i>Mimetes</i> which are both undescribed.
Unfortunately, it was not possible at the time to figure both plants,
but we hope to publish a figure and description of the second species in
our next volume. The genus, which is represented by nine species, falls
into two well-defined groups, (<i>a</i>) those with an ovoid stigma
(represented by <i>M. capitulata</i>, figured on Plate 58) and (<i>b</i>) those
species with a linear stigma (represented by <i>M. palustris</i>, figured on
Plate 36). Hitherto only two species of the first group were known, but
these recent acquisitions from Mr. Stokoe increases this number to four.</p>

<p>The species figured in the accompanying plate was found on the
Hottentot’s Holland Mountains S.E. of Kogelberg<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> and was growing on the
banks of a steep, fairly moist slope. When fresh, it is a most beautiful
object, certainly one of the most handsome species of the genus. The
styles are bright red, white just below the stigma, and the stigma
brownish-black. It is characterised by the regular excavations on the
surface of the stigma which appear to be receptacles for the pollen
grains.</p>

<p>Specimens are preserved in the National Herbarium, Pretoria (Herb. No.
1641).</p>

<p>This is one of the shrubby species of <i>Senecio</i> with succulent stems
found in Natal. In cultivation it makes an ornamental shrub having very
large yellow-rayed heads. The species was first collected by the late
Dr. Medley Wood at Murchison in Natal in 1884 (<i>Wood</i> 3065), and was
brought to him from Krantzkloof in August 1915. Dr. Wood had an
illustration made for vol. vii of the “Natal Plants,” but did not draw
up a description, as specimens were sent to Kew for identification. The
present illustration was made from a specimen which flowered in the
garden of the Natal Herbarium. This species was the last which Dr.
Medley Wood worked at the day before his death.</p>

<p>Specimens are preserved in the National Herbarium, Pretoria (Herb. No.

<p>We have previously figured two species of <i>Protea</i> belonging to
different sections of the genus. On Plate 22 will be found <i>P.
abyssinica</i> (§ <i>Lasiocephalae</i>) with a large head not contracted into a
scaly peduncle at the base, while on Plate 76 we figured <i>P. recondita</i>
(§ <i>Leiocephalae</i>) with a smaller head and a scaly peduncle. Our present
plant belongs to quite a separate section (<i>Ligulatae</i>), which is
characterised by the inner involucral bracts being produced into a long
claw with an oblong or oblanceolate limb. <i>Protea compacta</i> is a common
plant in some parts of the Cape Province, especially in the Caledon
Division, but is also found in parts of the Cape and Stellenbosch
Divisions, and a single specimen, collected by Zeyher, has been recorded
from the van Staden’s Mountains. In its natural habitat it is a bush 4-6
ft. high with brilliant pink bracts partly surrounded by the uppermost
leaves, and in many localities the flowering bush is one of the features

<p>In an earlier part, on Plate 64, we figured a Transvaal plant, <i>Gazania
pygmaea</i>, and stated it to be one of the first species to flower on
burnt veld. The plant illustrated here is usually contemporary with the
above, and before any of the other veld plants show signs of growth
numerous inflorescences of <i>Gerbera plantaginea</i> may be seen pushing
through the hard surface of the soil. The underground rootstock is well
adapted to withstand the long, dry winter months, and can store up
sufficient moisture to commence growth before the first summer rains
begin. The plant is usually found growing in small colonies, and the
colour of the ray-florets varies from pure white to yellow and through
various shades of pink to red. Like <i>Gazania pygmaea</i>, this species was
found by Burke and Zeyher on the Magaliesberg about the year 1841, and
Harvey, in the “Flora Capensis,” based his description on their
specimen. We are indebted to Mr. D. Fouche for the specimens which were
collected near Meintjes Kopje, Pretoria. They are preserved in the
National Herbarium, Pretoria (Herb. No. 2580).</p>

<p>The <i>Aloe</i> here represented differs from any we have previously
illustrated by having the leaves arranged in three ranks which may
become spirally twisted. In the “Flora Capensis” this character is used
to distinguish a sub-genus “Gonialoe” which contains only the species
<i>A. variegata</i>. The species is one of the oldest and most common aloes
in cultivation. A coloured illustration appeared in the <i>Botanical
Magazine</i> (t. 513) in 1801, and it is recorded that a Mr. Fairchild had
the species growing in England in 1720. For some reason the plant is not
well represented in European herbaria, as even in 1897, when the genus
was published in the “Flora Capensis,” the precise localities in which
the species occurs in South Africa remained doubtful. The traveller and
botanist, Carl Thunberg, collected the plant about 1772, and according
to Mr. N. E. Brown it is represented in the Thunberg herbarium by “two
leaves with the variegation on them well preserved, and a single
flower.”</p>

<p>The species is easy of cultivation and is propagated by means of suckers
which send up small plants. From the plant in cultivation at Pretoria,
four offshoots have developed in one season.</p>

<p>We are enabled to figure this plant through the courtesy of Mrs. E.
Rood, of Van Rhynsdorp, who forwarded us the living plant, which
flowered at Pretoria in July 1922. Specimens are preserved in the
National Herbarium, Pretoria (No. 2575).</p>

<p>The genus <i>Ceratotheca</i>, of which there are five species known, is
confined to Africa, but the species figured in the accompanying plate is
the only one recorded in South Africa. The genus is closely related to
<i>Sesamum</i>, only differing by the capsule having two divergent horns or
spines at the apex instead of being acute or beaked as in the latter
genus. The species was first described in 1842 under the name
<i>Sporledera triloba</i>, but, as pointed out in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i>
under Tab. 6974, there is no justification for establishing a genus to
include this species separate from <i>Ceratotheca</i>. The oldest record from
South Africa appears to be specimens collected by Drège between the
Umtata and St. John’s River, but since then it has been found by
numerous collectors. When fresh, the leaves have a very objectionable
odour. The plant is very common during January on the hills at
Wonderboom, near Pretoria. Our specimen was collected by Dr. R. Reitz.

<p>This new <i>Hyobanche</i> is the only recorded species for Natal. Bews
(“Flora of Natal and Zululand”) records <i>H. sanguinea</i> from Umzumbi, but
we suspect it is the species here described. It was first collected by
the late Dr. J. Medley Wood (Herb. Natal 11002) at Karridene Beach, and
recently Mr. Claude Fuller of Pretoria forwarded living specimens from
the same locality. Mr. Fuller was unable to determine the host on which
the parasite grew. It differs from <i>H. sanguinea</i>, as from all the other
known South African species, in having the lowest calyx segment very
much shorter than the others. The genus <i>Hyobanche</i> is very closely
related to <i>Harveya</i>, a species (<i>Harveya squamosa</i>) of which is figured
on Plate 67. Species of the two genera can easily be distinguished by an
examination of the stamens. In <i>Hyobanche</i> the anthers are one-celled,
while in <i>Harveya</i> the anthers are two-celled but only one cell contains
pollen. Specimens are preserved in the National Herbarium, Pretoria
(Herb. No. 1643).</p>

<hr />

<p>We are indebted to Mr. A. J. Austin for this charming little species of
<i>Romulea</i>, which is apparently undescribed. It was gathered at
Matjesfontein. The same species was collected a few years ago by
Schlechter (No. 8847) at Matjes River at an altitude of 2500 feet, and
distributed by him as <i>Romulea hirsuta</i>, Eckl., var. <i>aurantiaca</i>.
Although resembling <i>R. hirsuta</i> in general appearance, it is easily
distinguished by the colour of the flowers and especially by the very
broadly membranous margins of the inner spathe valve. The flowers close
up at night.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the genus <i>Romulea</i> in South Africa is still very
meagre, and much field-work is necessary in order to understand the
range and variability of the species.</p>

<p>Van Rhynsdorp District: Van Rhynsdorp, <i>Mrs. E. Rood</i> in <i>National

<hr />

<p>This extremely fine species of <i>Lachenalia</i> was sent to the Division of
Botany by Mrs. E. Rood of Van Rhynsdorp, who states that the plant is
quite common there. It belongs to an endemic South African genus of
about fifty species, and surpasses any other species known to us in the
rich colouring of the flowers. It flowers during August and September,
and should make a welcome addition to the bulb garden as one of the
earlier flowering species. There has been some doubt about the identity
of this plant, and we were inclined to regard it as <i>L. carnosa</i>, Baker,
which was collected by Drège in Little Namaqualand. Mr. N. E. Brown, of
Kew, very kindly examined the plate, and is of the opinion that it is
not this species, and that nothing like it is in the Kew Herbarium. It,
however, is very near <i>L. carnosa</i>, Baker, but may be distinguished from
this species in the inner perianth segments being longer than the outer
and in the far exserted stamens. This latter character is not constant,
as we find after examining a large series of specimens that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> length
to which the stamens are exserted from the perianth depends on the age
of the flower. The stamens are in more or less two unilateral rows, the
lower three ripening before the upper three.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;<i>Bulb</i> 2·5 cm. long, 1·8 cm. in diameter, ovoid, covered
with black membranous tunics with many fibrous roots from the base.
<i>Leaves</i> 2, erect-spreading, 7-14 cm. long, 2-4 cm. broad in the widest
part; the outer leaf always larger than the inner leaf,
ovate-lanceolate, obtuse, sometimes mucronate, narrowed and clasping at
the base, with reddish margins, glabrous. <i>Peduncle</i> 2-3·5 cm. long,
about 7 mm. in diameter, partially hidden by the clasping leaf bases.
<i>Inflorescence</i> a dense many-flowered spike, 9-14 cm. long; axis fleshy,
up to 8 cm. in diameter at the base, narrowing upwards, with a number of
facets, each facet bearing a flower at the base. <i>Bracts</i> about 1 mm.
long, ovate, obtuse, forming a small pocket from which the flower
arises. <i>Flowers</i> subsessile; pedicels about 1 mm. long. <i>Perianth</i>
purplish, 1-1·2 cm. long, campanulate, oblique at the base; tube about 3
mm. long, about 5 mm. in diameter above; lobes of outer segments 8 mm.
long, 4·75 mm. broad, oblong-ovate, obtuse, rostrate on the outer

<hr />

<p>This is the first occasion upon which we have had an opportunity of
figuring a member of the Natural Order <i>Bruniaceae</i>, which is one of the
endemic South African families. The <i>Bruniaceae</i> comprise about fifty
species, all confined to the south-western portion of the Cape Province.
The genera <i>Brunia</i> and <i>Berzelia</i> often form a conspicuous feature in
the landscape in some areas, the spherical heads of white flowers making
the bushes noticeable amongst the surrounding vegetation.</p>

<p>The species figured here was collected in 1922 by Mr. T. P. Stokoe on
the Hottentot Hollands Mountains near Hang Klip, and forwarded by him to
the Division of Botany, Pretoria. Near the same locality Mr. Stokoe
discovered another species of <i>Brunia</i>, which is undescribed. We do not
know of either of these species having been previously collected, and
the fact that undescribed and rare plants have recently been found on
such a well-known mountain range as the Hottentot Hollands, proves that
there must be a large area, within easy reach of Cape Town, which has
not yet been thoroughly botanically explored.</p>

<p>This plant, although previously figured in botanical publications, has
been thought worthy of another illustration, especially as the former
figures are not generally available to cultivators of South African
succulents.</p>

<p>The first species of this interesting genus was brought to the notice of
botanists in 1874 by Sir Henry Barkly, who sent specimens to Kew, where
it flowered the following year. Since then other species have come to
light, and we now know of seven species of the genus occurring in the
desert regions of the Cape Province and Namaqualand.</p>

<p>The specimen figured was collected by Mrs. D. van der Bijl,
Kruidfontein, Fraserburg District, in 1921, and sent to the Division of
Botany, where it flowered in September 1922. The plant sends up numerous
stems 9-12 inches high, and on these flowers profusely. The flowers are
martius yellow (Ridgway Colour Standards) in colour, with a dark corona
standing out in sharp relief in the middle of the saucer-shaped corolla.
Like many other members of this group of plants, the flowers have a
disagreeable odour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;Plant 6-8 in. high in the specimens seen (12-15 in.

<p>This species, which belongs to one of the large South African genera of
the iris family, differs from all genera of <i>Iridaceae</i> hitherto figured
in this publication in having small brown spathe valves. The genus is
represented in South Africa by over thirty species, mostly confined to
the coastal region of the Cape Province, but with a few in Namaqualand,
Natal, and the Transvaal. <i>Tritonia lineata</i> is the most widely
distributed species of the genus, occurring in the Mossel Bay, Bathurst,
Albany, Stockenstroom, and Somerset East Divisions, and extending into
East Griqualand, Basutoland, and Natal.</p>

<p>The species here figured is a new record for the Transvaal, and was
found by Mrs. H. M. Wood at Graskop, Pilgrim’s Rest. Plants were sent to
the National Botanic Gardens, Kirstenbosch, and flowered there during
February of the years 1918-1921 (National Botanic Gardens, No. 542/16).

<p>Although the South African <i>Proteaceae</i> are usually conspicuous plants
and have been recently monographed in the <i>Flora Capensis</i>, undescribed
species continue to be discovered. This is the case with the plant here
figured, which was collected in November 1922 by Mr. T. P. Stokoe near
Kogel Bai, on the Hottentots Holland Mountains at an altitude of 2500
ft.</p>

<p>Mr. Stokoe describes it as a plant of straggling growth among loose
stones and grass. We have previously figured a species of this genus
(Plate 74), and readers are referred to the description there for the
principal differences between the genera <i>Protea</i> and <i>Leucospermum</i>.</p>

<p>The decumbent habit of this species is also found in <i>Leucospermum
hypophyllum</i>, but is not common in the family.</p>

<p>Our plate was prepared from fresh plants forwarded by Mr. Stokoe.</p>

<p>This Aloe, known as the common soap-aloe, was introduced into
cultivation in Europe early in the eighteenth century, and it still
retains its popularity. Three colour varieties are known: one with
salmon-coloured flowers, one with red flowers, and one with pale
lemon-yellow flowers. The inflorescence in all these varieties may be
either simple or branched. The plants are common on the south and east
coasts of South Africa.</p>

<p>The buds just before the flowers open are between 3 and 4 cm. long, and
in about four days are completely open, and then a little over 4 cm.
long. The stamens do not all ripen at the same time; two or three
project and shed their pollen, being followed after a short interval by
the remainder. While the stamens are dehiscing the style remains within
the perianth and lengthens only after the pollen has been shed. It then
projects beyond the perianth, which now begins to wither and close
tightly round the style. While this is taking place the filaments
contract by twisting and are drawn back into the perianth. The inclusion
of the style during the dehiscence of the anthers and its subsequent
projection ensures cross-pollination.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Synnotia</i> is one of the endemic genera of the family
<i>Iridaceae</i>, and has hitherto only been represented by two species. The
species here figured is a new record for the genus in South Africa. On
Plate 60 we figured a species of <i>Sparaxis</i>, and a comparison of that
plate with the present one will show that the two genera <i>Sparaxis</i> and
<i>Synnotia</i> are nearly related: the rootstock, inflorescence, and spathe
valves are the same in both, but the former has regular flowers, while
in the latter genus the flowers are irregular.</p>

<p>The species is found near Eendekuil in the Clanwilliam Division, and the
original description was prepared from specimens flowering in the garden
of Mrs. F. Metelerkamp. We are indebted to the Curator of the Bolus

three representatives, two in Natal and one in the Transvaal. The
species figured here is the common one in the Transvaal, being found all
along the rocky outcrops of the Magaliesberg range and known as “stam

which are oval in shape, are somewhat larger than a cherry, and are used
to make preserve. The plants flower in October and ripe fruits are
formed in January. A milky juice characteristic of all the species in

<p>This species of <i>Cyrtanthus</i> belongs to the same group as the species
figured on Plate 25 (<i>C. sanguineus</i>). The group is characterised by
having a single flower or few flowers in each umbel. Our previous
illustrations of <i>Cyrtanthus</i> should be compared with the above two and
the present plate. <i>C. helictus</i>, which is an exceptionally graceful
representative of the genus, has not been extensively collected by
botanists, and we know of its occurrence in the Somerset East, Graaff
Reinet, Fort Beaufort, and Queenstown Divisions only. It should
certainly engage the attention of cultivators of South African plants,
as it is well worthy of a place in the bulb garden.</p>

<p>This species of <i>Protea</i> was collected early in 1921 by Mr. T. P.
Stokoe. At the time there was some doubt about its identity, and it was
provisionally placed under <i>P. speciosa</i>. Recently we received more and
better material from the same collector, and have no hesitation in
describing it as a species allied to <i>P. speciosa</i>. It differs from this
species in having shorter tufts of hairs at the apices of the involucral
bracts and the awns of the perianth are much longer and subequal. The
species belongs to a section of the genus <i>Speciosae</i>, which is
characterised by having the inner involucral bracts fringed with long
hairs or bearded. A comparison should be made with Plates 22, 76 and 84,
which illustrate examples of other sections of the genus.</p>

<p>The first specimens collected by Mr. Stokoe came from an isolated krantz
on a peak directly opposite Kogelberg on the land side, and subsequently
he found specimens also on high peaks facing Kogelberg, but on the
seaward side. It probably does not occur lower than an altitude of 3000
ft. The plant is a spreading bush about 6 ft. high<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span> (not so compact as
<i>P. speciosa</i>), and grows with such moisture-loving plants as <i>Mimetes

<hr />

<p>An extremely ornamental shrub found in the eastern Transvaal, where it
has been recorded from Waterval Onder, ’Thlatikulu and Barberton. The
plant does quite well at Pretoria, where specimens have been planted on
Meintjes Kop behind the Union Buildings.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Greyia</i>, which contains only three known species, was named
in honour of Sir George Grey, K.C.B. In South Africa it has a very
limited distribution, and is interesting botanically, as there are still
some doubts as to its affinities.</p>

<p>In the Transvaal the plant flowers from July to October, the young
leaves appearing at the same time as the scarlet flowers. The flowers
are proterandrous, <i>i. e.</i>, the pollen is shed before the pistil has
quite matured, and this makes self-pollination almost impossible.</p>

<p>The Cape species, <i>Greyia Sutherlandi</i>, is commonly known as “Baakhout”
or “Wild bottlebrush,” so that our plant might be appropriately named
the “Transvaal Baakhout.” The material from which our illustration was
made was gathered by Miss S. Gower on Meintjes Kop, Pretoria.</p>

<p>For a roller account of this interesting genus the reader is referred to
a paper by Dr. S. Schonland in the <i>Records of the Albany Museum</i>, vol.
iii. p. 40.</p>

<p>This curious <i>Mesembryanthemum</i> was first collected by Carl Thunberg
between the Oliphants River and the Bokkeveld Mountains about 150 years
ago. Thunberg described his plant in 1789, and in his herbarium there is
one sheet with two perfect growths and two flowers upon it. Marloth
(<i>Flora of South Africa</i>, Pl. 49) figures a small portion of a plant
which, he states, was collected at Van Rhynsdorp by Mr. W. Spilhaus and
was as large as a child’s head. The specimens from which our
illustration was made were collected in the same locality by Mr. E. Rood
and sent to the Division of Botany, Pretoria.</p>

<p>The corpuscula, which are very succulent, show an extremely interesting
structure when examined in detail. If a longitudinal section is made, a
hard green central core is seen, which is the stem; this is surrounded
by long, crystalline cells, and the whole covered in by a juicy tissue.
As the green tissue is buried in the stem, it is very probable that the
crystalline cells referred to act as lenses and concentrate any light
which penetrates the outer tissue on to the chlorophyll-bearing cells.
The fleshy leaves are almost devoid of chlorophyll.</p>

<p>The flower is borne at the apex of the stem, but this can only be
satisfactorily seen in a longitudinal section. The crystalline cells are
continued round the base of the calyx.</p>

endemic. The species described here is known from the Cape Province,
Natal, Zululand, Swaziland and the northern Transvaal, and extends into
tropical Africa. Its occurrence near Pretoria, in a totally different

plant from specimens found near Durban by Mr. Sanderson, who stated it
was plentiful in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This plant was discovered in Natal by Mr. J. Sanderson, who sent living
specimens to Kew, where it flowered first in May 1869. From the material
a figure of the plant was published in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> of the
same year. This figure, however, does not accurately represent the plant
as it is known in its native habitat and in local cultivation. The
flowers are lilac, and not almost white, as indicated in the <i>Botanical
Magazine</i>. The late Dr. Medley Wood reproduced a pencil drawing of the
plant in “Natal Plants” in 1912, and states it “is a handsome shrub, but
it is of no economic value; it is found only in the coast and midland
districts of Natal, and does not seem to be very common.” <i>MacKaya
bella</i> differs from <i>Crossandra Greenstockii</i> (see Plate 77), which also
belongs to the <i>Acanthaceae</i>, in having almost a regular, not a 1-lipped
corolla.</p>

<p>Dr. Harvey, who first described the genus, dedicated it to Dr. J. T.
MacKay, keeper of the Dublin University Botanic Garden. Our figure was
prepared from plants growing in the “Flanagan Arboretum,” Union
Buildings, Pretoria.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Adenium</i> is represented in South Africa by three species
found in the Transvaal, Swaziland and the North-Western Cape Province.
Species of the genus are also found extending through tropical Africa to
Socotra. On Plate 16 we figured <i>Adenium multiflorum</i>, from which the
present plant differs in having long narrow leaves; both, however, have
very large tuberous underground stems from which the branches arise. The
peculiar tailed anthers and the scales in the corolla-throat which
sometimes form small pouches are characteristic of the genus.</p>

<p>Specimens were submitted to Kew for confirmation of the name, and the

<p>The Aloe which forms the subject of this plate is, so far as is known,
only found on the Bokkeveld beds in the Clanwilliam and Van Rhynsdorp
Districts of the Cape Province. Full-grown plants attain a height of
12-15 ft., and when in full bloom, which is usually during December and
January, their long massive inflorescences make such a display of colour
in the veld that they cannot fail to attract the notice of the
traveller. As will be seen from the illustration, the uppermost flowers
are hidden by the long bracts, the flowers in the middle portion of the
inflorescence are pink and spreading, while those at the base are
pendulous and greenish-white. The stamens are only exserted from the
pendulous flowers, and after pollination the filaments contract and are
withdrawn into the perianth, which closes round them, leaving the style
exserted. This phenomenon is also found in <i>Aloe saponaria</i> figured on
Plate 96, and is probably fairly general in the genus <i>Aloe</i>.</p>

<p>The material from which our plate was made was collected by Dr. I. B.
Pole Evans, C.M.G., on the Doorn River near Van Rhynsdorp, and brought
to Pretoria, where the plants flower regularly every year during
December and January. <i>Aloe comosa</i> was first collected and described by
Dr. R. Marloth, who found it between Clanwilliam and Van Rhynsdorp in
1904.</p>

<br />
</p>

<p><i>Triaspis Nelsoni</i> was first described and figured in 1883 from material
collected by Mr. W. Nelson at Pretoria. The figure given by Hooker is
incorrect in a few small details. The pedicels, for instance, are
articulated and bear 2 small bracteoles; the three styles are not equal,
but one is longer than the other two and is deflexed at an angle of
about 45°; the anterior petal is exterior in the bud and larger than the
other petals.</p>

<p>The genus Triaspis is found in Madagascar, tropical and southern Africa,
and was first recorded by the famous traveller Burchell, who collected
specimens of a plant he described as <i>T. hypericoides</i> at Kosi Fountain
in Bechuanaland in 1812. Since then several species have been recorded
from the Transvaal.</p>

<p>The species figured on the accompanying plate is of frequent occurrence
on the soils overlying the dolomite outcrops south of Pretoria at an
elevation of 4000-5000 ft. above sea-level. It forms a subherbaceous
bush not more than two feet high, and the main branches always tend to
droop. When in flower it is a most attractive and beautiful object in
the veld, and is well worth cultivation in our gardens. In addition to
the beauty of its flowers, its large copper-coloured orbicular winged
fruits add considerably to its charm and gracefulness. The material from
which our plate was prepared was collected by Dr. I. B. Pole Evans,
C.M.G., on the farm Doornkloof, Irene, near Pretoria, belonging to
General the Rt. Hon. J. C. Smuts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A subherbaceous plant with long slender<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> and graceful

<p>Dr. R. Marloth supplies the following interesting note on this plant.
“Originally found by Mr. Eustace Pillans (not Mr. N. Pillans, as stated
in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i>) on the farm Mouton Valley on the Piquetberg
mountains to the north-west of Piquetberg.</p>

<p>The present plants were gathered by me at the same locality in October
1922 on sandstone hills among <i>Protea</i> trees (waabom, <i>P. grandiflora</i>),
forming shrublets 1½ to 2 ft. high with erect virgate branches.</p>

<p>The description in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> is fairly correct, but the
coloured petals are all radiating on the wild plants (not some erect and
conniving, as stated in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> for the cultivated
plants). They are arranged in 5 groups in front of the sepals. The
stigmata are distinct and papillate in the later stages of the flower.</p>

<p>The plant is easily cultivated at Cape Town, and I have had it in flower
for several years from September to December.</p>

<p>The flowers are of special biological interest. The stamens do not stand
erect as in most other species, but are incurved towards the centre to
such an extent that the filaments from opposite stamens meet and the
anthers are consequently enclosed in the lentil-shaped cavity thus
formed above the concave apex of the ovary. The roof of this cavity is
further strengthened by the filiform white inner petals which possess a
rough surface and are also tightly incurved inwards, meeting at the
centre.</p>

<p>The pollen is produced in profusion, and a mass of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span> powder is
found in every flower when slit open at this stage. In all the flowers
examined by me I found a number of small black beetles not more than 2
mm. long and a few specimens of haplothrips, all thoroughly covered with
pollen. These insects are able to force their way in between the
filaments and inner petals, but cannot escape until the stamens wither.
Up to that time no stigmatic surfaces are visible in the centre of the
flower, but within a few days, when the flower is about a week old and
when the pollen at first accumulated in the concave apex of the ovary
has been blown away by the wind, the stigmas develop to a length of 2-3
mm., showing a papillate surface, and are then in a condition to be
cross-pollinated by the insects released from flowers in the first
stage.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A succulent plant. <i>Branches</i> glabrous, angled and
somewhat winged. <i>Leaves</i> connate 2·8-4 cm. long, ovate, acute, flat

<p><i>Aloe microcantha</i>, which forms the subject of the accompanying plate,
occurs frequently in the open grass veld along the eastern mountain
range from Grahamstown northwards as far as the valley of the Limpopo.
In Swaziland and the eastern Transvaal it is usually found along the
edges of streams and in marshy places. In localities of high rainfall,
such as Haenertsberg on the Drakensbergen in the Transvaal, this plant
is often a conspicuous and beautiful object on the grassy slopes facing
east. It flowers during January and February. As soon as the seed has
set, a few months later, the leaves wither almost completely to their
bases, leaving a short stem surrounded by a few dried leaves to weather
the winter drought.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. Chas. Maggs of Pretoria for the specimen figured
in our illustration. It was collected by Mr. Maggs on his Waterval
Estate, near Sabie, on the Drakensberg, in January 1921, and forwarded
to the Division of Botany, where it flowered in January the following
year.</p>

<p><i>Aloe microcantha</i> was first collected by Bowie and introduced into
cultivation in 1819. It was figured in Curtis’ <i>Botanical Magazine</i> in
1821 as a plant of great rarity from the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

habit and having the nerves of the leaves and petioles covered with
prickles. It is a common plant on the slopes of the Drakensberg in
Natal, extending southward to Grahamstown, and during the summer months
the bright red flowers are very conspicuous in the veld. The leaves of
this species, as well as those of <i>E. caffra</i>, are attacked by a
gall-producing insect, and the seeds are attacked by insects to such an
extent that it is difficult to find ripe seed.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Adenia</i> described below and figured on the accompanying
Plate is of special interest, inasmuch as the large tuberous roots have
proved to be extremely poisonous. In October 1922 the plant was brought
to the notice of the Division of Botany by Dr. H. Osborne of Pretoria,
who reported that two white labourers were admitted to the Pretoria
Hospital suspected of having been poisoned by eating a portion of the
root, and that one of them died shortly after admission to the Hospital.
A sample of the root sent in by Dr. Osborne was submitted to Drs. H. H.
Green and W. H. Andrews of the Division of Veterinary Research, and as a
result of their investigations two types of poison were discovered. One
of these acts very rapidly, and with symptoms which can be attributed to
the small amount of a cyanogetic glucoside; the other acts more slowly,
but its chemical nature is as yet unknown. A full account of these
investigations will be published in the <i>Report of the Director of
Veterinary Research</i>.</p>

<p>The fruits of <i>Adenia digitata</i> are berries of a very attractive nature,
and also appear to be poisonous, for some years ago in the Pretoria
District two native children died after eating them.</p>

<p>The plant is quite common in the Pretoria District, and also occurs in
the Barberton District. It has long, graceful branches provided with
tendrils, by means of which it climbs up neighbouring bushes and shrubs.</p>

<hr />

<p>This plant is popularly known as “rooi knol,” because of the deep red
colour of the tubers when cut, and it is also known as “Spinnekop blom,”
as the colour and marking of the perianth resemble that of some spiders.
The latter name is also applied to <i>Ferraria undulata</i> (see Plate 66 for
an illustration of a species of the genus).</p>

<p>The species was known in England at least as early as 1767, as there is
a record of its introduction into Kew Gardens in that year. The dull
brown colour of the flowers, which is rare among South African plants,
does not make the plant a very ornamental object in gardens, but as the
plant is interesting botanically it should have a place in any
collection of the native flora.</p>

<p>The family <i>Haemodoraceae</i> contains about 120 species, found principally
in Australia, but species are also known in North and South America and
in Asia. In South Africa the family is represented by less than 50
species, the largest genus being <i>Sansevieria</i>. The genus <i>Wachendorfia</i>
is known by only two species.</p>

<p>Our plate was prepared from plants sent by Mrs. E. Rood, Van Rhynsdorp;
they flowered at the Division of Botany in 1922.</p>

<p>On Plate 6 we figured a variety of this magnificent species of
<i>Gladiolus</i>, which differs from our present plant not only in the
colouring of the flower, but also in the size of the perianth-segments.</p>

<p>It was figured in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> (t. 3032) from specimens
which flowered at Kew, and was known in cultivation in England at least
as early as 1830, and in Holland before that date.</p>

<p>A bed of plants growing at the Division of Botany, Pretoria, made an
exceptionally fine display this season (1923), and there can be little
doubt that it is the finest native <i>Gladiolus</i> to be found in South
Africa.</p>

<p>The plant is quite easily propagated, and forms new corms very readily.
It is commonly known as the “Natal Lily.” Our plate was prepared from
specimens forwarded by Mr. H. E. Forsyth, the Curator, Municipal Park,
Benoni, and were stated to have been collected in Portuguese East
Africa.</p>

Pretoria, from seed collected by Dr. J. M. Troup at Aus in South-west
Africa. The plant flowers freely and makes a splendid display, and as a
garden plant for supplying cut flowers it is well worth cultivation.</p>

<p>Seed was sent by the Chief of the Division of Botany to Kew in 1918, and
the plants raised were figured in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> (t. 8845).
Mr. J. Hutchinson, who drew up the description for the <i>Botanical

pappus, whereas in <i>Venidium</i> the pappus is either absent or very

<p>This pretty little orchid is quite a common plant in the grass veld
during the summer months, and has been extensively gathered by botanical
collectors, though strangely enough it is not generally met with in
gardens. It has been known to botanists for about sixty years, but under
the name <i>E. bicolor</i>, until Sir Joseph Hooker in 1893 pointed out that
this name had already been assigned to another species in the genus, and
published the present name <i>E. Zeyheri</i>.</p>

<p>The tubers resemble a string of large beads, and send out leaves and
roots from the constrictions between the swollen portions. The plant has
been successfully grown in Gloucestershire, England, by the late Mr. H.
J. Elwes, and should certainly receive the attention of South African
cultivators.</p>

<p>Our illustration was made from specimens collected by Dr. I. B. Pole
Evans, C.M.G., at Irene, near Pretoria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;An acaulescent herb with large underground fleshy tubers 7
cm. long, about 5 cm. in diameter, and thick cylindric roots arising
from the junction of the tuber and short stem. <i>Leaves</i> three to four to
a plant, 19 to 30 cm. long, 1·5 to 3 cm. broad, lanceolate linear,
subacuminate, acute, plicate, with the primary nerves prominent beneath,
glabrous. <i>Inflorescence</i> lateral, racemose, about 26-flowered.
<i>Peduncle</i> about 30 cm. long, surrounded by brown membranous sheaths 8
to 9 cm. long. <i>Floral-bracts</i> 4 cm. long, linear, acuminate, acute.
<i>Pedicels</i> about 6 mm. long. <i>Sepals</i> 2·8 cm. long, 1·1 cm. broad,
ovate-lanceolate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span> shortly acuminate, acute, the upper sepal slightly
narrower. <i>Side petals</i> 2·6 cm. long, 1 cm. broad, lanceolate, acute.
<i>Lip</i> 3 cm. long, 1·3 cm. broad, 3-lobed; the middle lobe, obovate,
obtuse, sparsely covered with short filaments and produced at the base
into 2 keels; side lobes deep purple, 8 mm. long, 9 mm. broad,
ovate-oblong, obtuse, unequal sided; spur 5 mm. long, slightly curved,
terete, blunt. <i>Column</i> 1 cm. long, 3 mm. broad, oblong, convex on the
back, deeply concave on the face. <i>Operculum</i> ovate; pollinia ovate,
attached to a single gland. <i>Stigma</i> kidney-shaped. (National Herb.

<p>This species differs from the one we previously figured (<i>H. Zeyheri</i>,
Plate 43) in not having a short perianth-tube above the ovary. The
species here figured is evidently quite common in some localities in the
High Veld, growing amongst the grass, but has not been extensively
collected. Rehmann first found the plant on which Baker based his
description, and it has since been found by Miss Saunders and Mr. E. E.
Galpin near Johannesburg. Our illustration was made from specimens
collected by Dr. I. B. Pole Evans, C.M.G., at Kaalfontein, between
Pretoria and Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Baker in his description mentions that the pedicels are strongly angled,
but we suspect that is solely due to drying, as in the fresh material
the pedicels are quite terete.</p>

<p>Like many other plants belonging to the <i>Amaryllidaceae</i>, the seeds may
commence germination before falling from the capsule.</p>

<p>As far as we are aware the species has no common name, and we would
suggest “wit sambrieltje” for this little plant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;<i>Bulb</i> 1·8 cm. long, 1·5 cm. in diameter, globose, covered
with papery tunics and produced into a neck about 1 to 1·5 cm. long.
<i>Leaves</i> usually one, more rarely two, 9 cm. long, filiform, quite
terete or with a shallow channel, glabrous. <i>Peduncle</i> 15 cm. long,
terete, glabrous. <i>Inflorescence</i> a centripetal umbel of about nine
flowers. <i>Spathe-valves</i> 2 mm. long, ovate, acute. <i>Pedicels</i> 8 mm.
long, terete, glabrous. <i>Perianth-segments</i> 8 mm. long, 1·5 mm. broad,
linear, much crisped, with 3 segments minutely and bluntly apiculate and
with papillae at the apex. <i>Filaments</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span> attached to base of
perianth-segments, 5 mm. long, terete; anthers 1 mm. long, orbicular,
basifixed. <i>Ovary</i> 2·5 mm. in diameter, globose, glabrous with a single
ovule in each cell; style 7 mm. long, terete; stigmas 3, papillose.

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
